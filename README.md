# Minecraft Update 2.2.1
The update you've all waited too long for!

IMPORTANT
==========
- This mod is made for 1.21.1 SINGLEPLAYER (might work with earlier 1.21 versions but haven't tested it yet)
- This mod does NOT require Fabric API.
- This mod is NOT compatible with Sodium, and compatibility with other mods is unlikely (since it changed basically everything).
- Mods that should work fine: Fabric API, Modmenu
- The source code will be released when this is more polished

Changelog
========
I have no idea why you would want to read through this since I obviously already told you everything in the video
